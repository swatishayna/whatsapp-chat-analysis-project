2021-09-17,7:36:52 PM,Suraj EDA Automation,Yes we can  But i was thinking we can connect tomorrow and review and discuss about the work and propose changes and With those changes and integration could be finished in 1 Or 2 days so We could submit lld around 19 or 20 sept
2021-09-17,7:37:56 PM,Suraj EDA Automation,If you are not able to complete due to some work we can help just ping here
2021-09-17,7:55:07 PM,Swati,Ok then we are connecting tomrw.. dev will try to finish it off today… else we will do tomrw.. by 19 we will try to submit… till then integration team you should start integrating the document.
