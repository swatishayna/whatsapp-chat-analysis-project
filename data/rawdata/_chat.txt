[16/09/21, 1:02:40 PM] Swati: Hello Everyone I have uploaded the assigned part.
[16/09/21, 1:05:13 PM] Swati: Just a suggestion: if everyone is done with their parts and those who are assigned with integration task have some spare time  then integration can be started. This way we will be ahead of deadline dates. 

Any say?
[16/09/21, 1:08:50 PM] ‪+91 87562 41676‬: For me, also i am yet to work on methods part, so that is pending from side
[16/09/21, 1:09:01 PM] ‪+91 87562 41676‬: Will try finish it by today
[16/09/21, 1:16:02 PM] Swati: Ok no problem we still have 2 buffer days

[17/09/21, 6:50:53 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: I have completed

Also there is supposed to be a meeting schedule today I think
[17/09/21, 6:53:06 PM] Swati: Yes Suraj!! I think let Dev complete his task and let us meet tomrw. Dev would you be able to finish it off by today or u need someone’s help?
[17/09/21, 6:54:17 PM] ‪+91 87562 41676‬: Actually i am still figuring out about the methods, will try to finish today, if i need someone's help I'll let you all know
[17/09/21, 7:00:36 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Yes
[17/09/21, 7:01:22 PM] Swati: Ok plz try to cover it up today.
[17/09/21, 7:03:07 PM] ‪+91 84691 75155‬: I guess everyone can look at each other's contribution and suggest any edits using comments
[17/09/21, 7:36:52 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Yes we can 

But i was thinking we can connect tomorrow and review and discuss about the work and propose changes and
With those changes and integration could be finished in 1 Or 2 days so
We could submit lld around 19 or 20 sept
[17/09/21, 7:37:56 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: If you are not able to complete due to some work we can help just ping here
[17/09/21, 7:55:07 PM] Swati: Ok then we are connecting tomrw.. dev will try to finish it off today… else we will do tomrw.. by 19 we will try to submit… till then integration team you should start integrating the document.
[17/09/21, 7:56:00 PM] Swati: Hitarth you can do your part (half integration) or u want any help?
[17/09/21, 8:01:47 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Hi 

I have not implemented cassandra and sqlite data ingestion methods

Because in cassandra I am having some issue and for sqlite 
" SQLite is not a traditional SQL Database, no server is necessary there is only a file " 
So we cannot ingest data from sqlite
[17/09/21, 8:26:31 PM] ‪+91 84691 75155‬: Yea sure I can start the integration work tonight
[17/09/21, 8:26:59 PM] ‪+91 84691 75155‬: Sure connecting tomorrow and discussing edits is also fine
[17/09/21, 8:28:46 PM] ‪+91 84691 75155‬: I thought we are just describing methods 😅, btw good work on discovering that👍🏽

[22/09/21, 2:34:47 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: No don't purchase
There are many free resources present on the Internet 
We are working on it
If you want to buy it for personal use like you want to get deep into streamlit in a structured way without moving into different resources so you can go ahead
[22/09/21, 2:36:22 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Update :

I have been looking into Streamlit and found that Streamlit is using something named tornado for internal working so 
I was finding difficulty for like can we integrate flask and streamlit 
Else all seems good
Also there is no header navbar
[22/09/21, 2:37:45 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: So please let me know if you all can fine some resources on ' how to integrate streamlit and flask '
[22/09/21, 3:28:53 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: Okay then leave it
[22/09/21, 5:45:48 PM] Swati: And what about the problem of going to next page? after login
[22/09/21, 5:57:29 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: It's resolved, 
I can explain it in the next meet or
Do I need to share the resources now
[22/09/21, 7:17:04 PM] Swati: you can share the resource let me go through it.

this is for all members
[22/09/21, 11:02:16 PM] Swati: This is not what I am looking for. I am able to create multiweb app with Streamlit... Yesterday we discussed login I wanted a clean slate once the user successfully loggedIn.. Which someone told me that is not possible with streamlit
[22/09/21, 11:39:08 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: I was assuming you problem statement was having multi-page application
[22/09/21, 11:40:29 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: From what I have heard we can run multiple apps and embed streamlit in the main app 
Have not reasearched about that
[22/09/21, 11:41:04 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: But the thing is we can only make single page application s in streamlit
[22/09/21, 11:41:20 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: But We can add components
[23/09/21, 1:14:19 AM] Suraj EDA Automation: I have looked into it but some concepts are not familiar to me

Very small tasks Just us a 15 mins of time will be sufficient
[25/09/21, 9:48:26 PM] Swati: what about class diagram?
[25/09/21, 9:48:54 PM] Swati: I think its not the complete list of tasks
[25/09/21, 9:49:50 PM] Swati: and process view as well. which is a huge task
[25/09/21, 9:49:57 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Once hitarth and dev are free we could get an update what's remaining from their side and reallocate tasks on Monday 

Because @918756241676 and @918469175155  has informed me they will be available after or from mondays onwarda
[25/09/21, 9:50:31 PM] Swati: oh okay.
[25/09/21, 9:51:18 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: That's when we will be allocating the class diagram and use case realizations table

[27/09/21, 12:03:45 AM] Suraj EDA Automation: Yes, we will be needing streamlit,
 most probably
[27/09/21, 12:06:34 AM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: I'll show an app tomorrow if possible. I have used multiple pages in it.

[27/09/21, 12:08:12 AM] Suraj EDA Automation: Ok sure
[27/09/21, 2:32:55 PM] Swati: Hi @everyone.    Please let me know if everyone is ready to restart our pending work from today. Also if they are unavailable for the next few days, then we can divide the work in between the rest, and they can join once they are back but plz inform in the group as well.
[27/09/21, 2:37:43 PM] Swati: Also from the starting, we have 1 doubt - which database to use to store datasets either Cassandra or Mongodb .
[27/09/21, 2:41:55 PM] Swati: So whenever we are going to meet next we will be discussing which database we should use, if you have some time you can dig into these two databases , check for the resources if have enough. Also since we are going to draw our project into Pytthon, plz make sure the resources are in abundant amount wrt python driver (not CQL shell)
[27/09/21, 2:42:15 PM] Swati: great

When everyone is free
[02/10/21, 7:22:19 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: By the way Cassandra Logging part is done.
[02/10/21, 7:22:40 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Ok

Explain it us in the meet
[02/10/21, 7:23:04 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: Means I completed in another group, so just need to copy and paste.
[02/10/21, 7:23:41 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Yes we will reuse our existing Resources
[02/10/21, 7:24:00 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: Yes , why need to do repeated task.
[02/10/21, 7:24:29 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Definitely

Just don't forget to explain us how things are working

[02/10/21, 7:25:30 PM] Swati: @919029788110 aise kiya hai logging ya something different?
[02/10/21, 7:25:54 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: Yea
[02/10/21, 7:25:57 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: Yes
[02/10/21, 7:26:00 PM] Swati: ok
[02/10/21, 7:26:31 PM] Swati: primary key timestamp hai some other data type?
[02/10/21, 7:27:00 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: But we are not capturing time date , rather we are capturing function's exception.
[02/10/21, 7:27:51 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: As app is basic one, no need to capture timestamp
[02/10/21, 7:28:46 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: It's just a one function .Py  file.
[02/10/21, 7:29:38 PM] Swati: timestamp is not for that purpose. I actually didnrt make any complex primary key, tried with only timetsamp column to make it unique. no other purpose and the columns are just for confirming if the process runs or not....
[02/10/21, 7:29:54 PM] Swati: @waiting for flask @919004520944
[02/10/21, 7:30:36 PM] Swati: @919004520944 will try to solve problem in the night.
[02/10/21, 7:30:53 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Good same time or some different time for meet?
[02/10/21, 7:31:13 PM] Suraj EDA Automation: Which problem
[02/10/21, 7:31:14 PM] ‪+91 90297 88110‬: It's awesome.
[02/10/21, 7:31:20 PM] Swati: give me some time I will tell you.
[02/10/21, 7:31:35 PM] Swati: dataset u shared na

[22/10/21, 8:32:10 PM] Swati: I am facing some issues in achieving recall scores in terms of classifying popular apps vs nonpopular apps where I am using RandomForestClassifier. My recall_score is not able to cross 47percent which is quite low in this case(expecting 70-80 %). I tried adjusting parameters like ccp_alphas , max_depth,min_samples_leaf but nothing made any significant changes. 
Please check this issue. The file path is notebooks\Transforming and Model Training.ipynb.
